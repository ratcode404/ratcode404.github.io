## What even is TPM?

The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed by TCG allows the storage of passwords, encryption keys and digital certificates. 

Think of it like a hardware password manager for low level systems, it generates and stores keys based on the configuration of the system. Incorporating TPM into your encryption means you're fending off people trying to decrypt data on a different system from the one it was encrypted with. Using TPM alone would be stupid - hardware failures happen - but when used alongside other methods it's a barrier that blocks off certain types of attack.

TPMs are also used by some apps and web services. For instance, Outlook uses a TPM for handling encrypted emails. Web browsers, on the other hand, utilize it for maintaining SSL certificates used to authenticate and create encrypted connections with websites.
