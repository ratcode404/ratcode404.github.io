## Setting up ISO 27001

While I am beginning to write on this, I realize that this will not be any blog post like my others; rather, this will be much more in-depth including considerations as well as mistakes on a project that I have recently undertaken. Over the next few months, I will be attempting to create all the necessary files and documentation for a corporate organization to be certified to ISO 27001.

## Document structure in LaTeX

From the beginning of the implementation I immediately understood how crucial it would be, to build up a reasonably functional LaTeX structure. This would enable me to easily modify, generate and backup the files.  
  
My very basic folder structure in the first week looked like this, including style sheets and VSCode workspace configurations.

    ├── ...
    ├── images                                              
    ├── sections                                            # LaTeX files
    │   ├── references                                      # Created Subreports
    │   │   ├── 5.2 Information security policy.pdf         # Generated PDF
    │   │   ├── 6.1.2 Information security risk assessment.pdf
    │   │   ├── 5.2 Information security policy.fdb_latexmk
    │   │   ├── 5.2 Information security policy.fls    
    │   ├── 5.2 Information security policy.tex             # .tex Files for every Policy
    │   ├── 6.1.2 Information security risk assessment.tex  
    │   └── style.sty                                       # style sheet
    ├── ISO 27001.workspace.code-workspace                  # VSCode workspace configuration
    └── ...

The workspace configuration was an important part, as the files genereted in references usually would create a big file mess in the main folder. Tidying the whole thing up, I wanted the LaTeX generated files to stay in a subfolder \references.

This are the settings that allowed me to do this:

```
{
    "folders": [
        {
            "path": "."
        }  
    ],
    "settings": {
        "latex-workshop.latex.outDir": "%DIR%/references"
    }
}
```
