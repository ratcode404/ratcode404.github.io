## Setting up ISO 27001

While I am beginning to write on this, I realize that this will not be any blog post like my others; rather, this will be much more in-depth including considerations as well as mistakes on a project that I have recently undertaken. Over the next few months, I will be attempting to create all the necessary files and documentation for a corporate organization to be certified to ISO 27001.

## Document structure in LaTeX

From the beginning of the implementation I immediately understood how crucial it would be, to build up a reasonably functional LaTeX structure. This would enable me to easily modify, generate and backup the files.
