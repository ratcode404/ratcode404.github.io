## 0.999... is equal to 1

Recently I stumbled across a repeating decimal notation - 0.999... - with a very interesting characteristic.  
This number is equal to 1. In other words, "0.999..." is not "almost exactly" or "very, very nearly but not quite" 1  –  rather, "0.999..." and "1" represent exactly the same number.  
  
If you have never had a closer look at this number, you will probably believe that this is just nonsense. But it isn't. There are multiple ways to proof that 0.999... is equal to 1.

Down below are a few of the many ways of showing this equality.

## Algebraic argument

The standard algebric proof runs something like this, presented by William Byers in 'How Mathematicians Think: Using Ambiguity, Contradiction, and Paradox to Create Mathematics'.

Surely if 9x = 9, then x = 1. But since x also equals 0.099... we get that 0.099... = 1. The algebra is impeccable.  

## Another algebraic argument

Not convinced yet? Here is another algebraic argument.

**1 / 3 of 1 equals 0.333..., but multiplying this with 3 gives 1 = 0.999**
